## A simple Book Listing app. 

It allows the user to search for a book title and will display 10 results. 
It is using the Google Books API.

In this project I learned to:
- Fetch data from an API
- Use an AsyncTask
- Parse a JSON response
- Cratea a list based on the data and display it to the user along with some optional information
